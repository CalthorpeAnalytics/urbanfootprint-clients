configuration` repository like this:

    git clone https://github.com/CalthorpeAnalytics/urbanfootprint.git urbanfootprint git clone
    https://github.com/CalthorpeAnalytics/urbanfootprint-configuration.git urbanfootprint-
    configuration

you would clone *your* forked `urbanfootprint-configuration` repository like this:

    https://github.com/YOUR-ORGANIZATION/urbanfootprint-configuration.git urbanfootprint-
